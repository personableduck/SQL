# Intro

There are a few things you will need to prepare before coming to class. We'll be using sqlite3 as the version of SQL for class. Installation instructions are below. If you encounter any problems, just come to class 15 mins early and your instructor will help you get set up.  

Additionally, we'll be working with a combination of command line statements and sql commands from text files for class.  Please install Sublime Text, which has a free trial version you can download from their website (http://www.sublimetext.com/).

If you're completely unfamiliar with the command line, I suggest you take some time to learn the basics before class.  It's not absolutely necessary, but you'll be able to spend more of your focus on learning SQL if you spend a little time preparing.  Here are a couple tutorials with some basics about the command line.  Watch the first few videos in the tutorial series:
